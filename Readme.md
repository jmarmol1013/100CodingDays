# 100CodingDays Repository

Welcome to the 100CodingDays repository! This repository is a personal coding challenge where I will solve a LeetCode problem each day for 100 days using a different programming language. The selected programming languages for this challenge are Java, Python, C#, TypeScript, and SQL.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to enhance my problem-solving skills and familiarize myself with multiple programming languages. By tackling a LeetCode problem every day, I will gain valuable experience in algorithmic thinking, data structures, and language-specific syntax.

## How It Works

1. Each day, I will choose a LeetCode problem to solve.
2. Assign a programming language from the available options (Java, Python, C#, TypeScript, or SQL) for that particular day.
3. Create a new folder with the problem's name or number as the folder name.
4. Write the solution to the problem in the chosen programming language.
5. Include a README file in each folder to document the process, explain the solution, and provide any additional insights.
6. Commit and push my solution to this repository.

## Folder Structure

The repository follows a simple folder structure to organize your solutions:

â”œâ”€â”€ Day001/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ problem_name/
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ solution_language.file_extension
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ Day002/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ problem_name/
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ solution_language.file_extension
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ README.md
