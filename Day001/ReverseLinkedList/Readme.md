# Day 1: Reverse Linked List

## Problem Description

Create a method to reverse a Linked List in Java

## Complexity Analysis

Running time O(n), I travel the complete linked list one time to reverse it

## Programming Language Used

Java

## Example

Exercise 1
    Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
    Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

Exercise 2
    Input: [1,2]
    Output: [2,1]

## Further Improvements

I used an Iterative method for this aproach; However it could be possible with a recursive method.
